## üìÉ Abstract

Pick-and-place is one of the fundamental tasks in robotics research. However, the attention has been mostly focused on the ‚Äúpick‚Äù task, leaving the ‚Äúplace‚Äù task relatively unexplored. In this paper, we address the problem of placing objects in the context of a teleoperation framework. Particularly, we focus on two aspects of the place task: stability robustness and contextual reasonableness of object placements. Our proposed method combines simulation-driven physical stability verification via real-to-sim and the semantic reasoning capability of large language models. In other words, given place context information (e.g., user preferences, object to place, and current scene information), our proposed method outputs a probability distribution over the possible placement candidates, considering the robustness and reasonableness of the place task. Our proposed method is extensively evaluated in two simulation and one real world environments and we show that our method can greatly increase the physical plausibility of the placement as well as contextual soundness while considering user preferences.

# Code Explanation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Before starting, you need to add your OpenAI API key in `/key/my_key.txt`. This is required for the receptacle reasoning process.

We have 3 Scenarios in this repository. Each scene consists of MJCF (MuJoCo XML) files for environment configuration and Jupyter notebooks for execution.

### A) Dish Rack Scene
The task is **To place the dish into a dish-rack**. There are three types of dish-racks available.

**Environment Files (MJCF)**:
- [scene_kitchen_dish_rack_black.xml](https://github.com/joonhyung-lee/spots/blob/main/asset/scene_kitchen_dish_rack_black.xml)
- [scene_kitchen_dish_rack_white.xml](https://github.com/joonhyung-lee/spots/blob/main/asset/scene_kitchen_dish_rack_white.xml)
- [scene_kitchen_dish_rack_small.xml](https://github.com/joonhyung-lee/spots/blob/main/asset/scene_kitchen_dish_rack_small.xml)

**Execution Files (Jupyter Notebooks)**:
You can find the execution code [here](https://github.com/joonhyung-lee/spots/tree/main/demo/scene/kitchen_with_dish):
- [Black-dish-rack.ipynb](https://github.com/joonhyung-lee/spots/blob/main/demo/scene/kitchen_with_dish/kitchen_rack_black_method.ipynb)
- [White-dish-rack.ipynb](https://github.com/joonhyung-lee/spots/blob/main/demo/scene/kitchen_with_dish/kitchen_rack_white_method.ipynb)
- [Small-dish-rack.ipynb](https://github.com/joonhyung-lee/spots/blob/main/demo/scene/kitchen_with_dish/kitchen_rack_small_method.ipynb)

### B) Bookshelf Scene
The task is **To place the book into a bookshelf**.

**Environment File (MJCF)**:
- [scene_office_bookshelf.xml](https://github.com/joonhyung-lee/spots/blob/main/asset/scene_office_bookshelf_small.xml)
- [scene_office_bookshelf_genre.xml](https://github.com/joonhyung-lee/spots/blob/main/asset/scene_office_bookshelf.xml)

**Execution File (Jupyter Notebook)**:
You can find the execution code [here](https://github.com/joonhyung-lee/spots/tree/main/demo/scene/office_bookshelf):
- [office_bookshelf.ipynb](https://github.com/joonhyung-lee/spots/blob/main/demo/scene/office_bookshelf/office_bookshelf_dense_method.ipynb)
- [office_bookshelf_genre.ipynb](https://github.com/joonhyung-lee/spots/blob/main/demo/scene/office_bookshelf/office_bookshelf_genre_method.ipynb)

### C) Category Scene
The task is **To place the object into a shelf**.

**Environment File (MJCF)**:
- [scene_category.xml](https://github.com/joonhyung-lee/spots/blob/main/asset/scene_realworld_w_shelf_category_ver2.xml)

**Execution File (Jupyter Notebook)**:
